            <h3>These are the rules:</h3>
            <p>
                - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br>
                - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score<br>
                - BUT, if the player rolls a 1 and double 6, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
                - The player can choose to 'Hold', so his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
                - The first player to reach the inputed final score or the default 100 points on GLOBAL score (if no final score is given) wins the game.<br><br>
